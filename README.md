Dataset download link : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehu9zIbmQPrW6DHJ8xQMVMBtAkM4mLSu/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111881146371025480890&rtpof=true&sd=true


## Overview
This project focuses on predicting audience ratings for movies using various machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed, and multiple models are trained and evaluated in parallel to find the best-performing one. The code includes downloading, preprocessing, training, and visualization steps.

---

## Features
- Downloads and extracts the dataset automatically.
- Preprocesses data with handling for both numerical and categorical features.
- Implements multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Utilizes parallel processing to train and evaluate models efficiently.
- Visualizes the performance of models and their predictions.
